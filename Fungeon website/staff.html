				Hello everyone! I am Rin! Welcome to my fungeon! Please feel free to check out the coffin, and let me know if you want me to close you in it, or join you for coffin cuddles! 😛 I am here to lend an ear (hehe), hang out, dance, chat, hopefully make you laugh a little! I will be glad to give private dances, get you something from the bar, have a chat, whatever!

				Edit to add: Per Fia, I am a Dommy Mommy Vampire Mistress as well 😄 (but not really a Dom hehe)
